# Warzone-SBMM-APP-Much-Improved
I created the largest publicly available SBMM study for COD Warzone not that long ago, but the code was really messy. Some people tried to read through it and it was very, very messy. So, this is a much cleaner version. I'll try to add documentation and a video to explain how to use it, but the gist is simple. You can load existing experiments or start new experiments. Using the various buttons, you can scrape basically any and all data from the codtracker website. You can get leaderboards, lifetime stats, and recent matches of individual players, groups of players, even the recent matches and lifetime stats for players in a variable number of your recent matches, or if you have a lot of time, you can do all that but for thousands of players from the leaderboard.
